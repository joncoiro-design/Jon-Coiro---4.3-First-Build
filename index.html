          <h4>Biography</h4>
          <p>Brock Purdy is an NFL quarterback who plays for the San Francisco 49ers. After playing for the Iowa for all 4 years, he was selected by the 49ers in 2022 as the final draft pick. As a result, he got the nickname "Mr. Irrelevant", traditionally used for the last pick in the NFL. He was not recognized too much in college, but that all changed on December 4, 2022, when the 49ers were taking on the Miami Dolphins. With the starting quarterback Trey Lance injured, Jimmy Garoppolo was the next man up, until he suffered a season ending injury that game. This was when Brock Purdy got his shot, and he did not disappoint. He led his team to victory and all the way to the NFC championship, to which they unfortunately lost to the Philadelphia Eagles. However, things were just getting started for him, as he had an even better first full rookie season to get his team all the way to the Superbowl. He remains the starting quarterback today, and only at 24 years old, he has served as an inspiration for future athletes across America.</p>
